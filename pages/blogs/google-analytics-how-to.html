  <h1>How to Add Google Analytics to Your GitHub Pages Website</h1>
  <p>
    Tracking your website visitors helps you understand traffic patterns, user engagement,
    and where your visitors are coming from. This guide walks you through the exact steps
    to set up Google Analytics (GA4) on a <strong>GitHub Pages (github.io)</strong> site, with
    clear explanations at every stage.
  </p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 1: Create a Google Analytics Property</h2>

    <h3>1. Open Google Analytics</h3>
    <p>
      Go to <a href="https://analytics.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
      https://analytics.google.com</a> and sign in using your Google account. Make sure this is
      the account you want to use for managing analytics.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Open the Admin Panel</h3>
    <p>
      Once signed in, find and click the <strong>Admin</strong> button (a gear icon in the
      bottom left). This opens the settings area where you can manage accounts, properties,
      and tracking settings.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Create or Select an Analytics Account</h3>
    <p>
      If this is your first time using Google Analytics, click <strong>Create Account</strong>.
      Enter a name that makes sense to you (for example, your website name). If you already
      have an account, simply select it from the list — you do not need a new account if an
      existing one will work.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Create a GA4 Property</h3>
    <p>
      Within the selected account, click <strong>Create Property</strong>. A property represents
      the website or application you want to track. Enter a descriptive name (such as your site's
      name or URL), choose the correct time zone, and select your reporting currency. Continue
      through the setup prompts. Business details or analytics goals are optional and do not
      affect the basic tracking setup.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Add a Web Data Stream</h3>
    <p>
      After creating the property, Google Analytics will prompt you to add a <strong>Data Stream</strong>.
      Choose <strong>Web</strong> as the platform. Enter your GitHub Pages URL, and be sure to
      include the <code>https://</code> prefix — for example:
    </p>
    <pre><code>https://yourusername.github.io</code></pre>

    <div class="note">
      Once you finish adding the Web data stream, Google Analytics will immediately show the
      full tracking code snippet (including your Measurement ID) directly on the page. You’ll
      use this snippet in the next step — there’s no need to copy just the ID separately.
    </div>

  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 2: Add the Tracking Code to Your GitHub Pages Site</h2>
    <p>
      The tracking code (called <strong>gtag.js</strong>) is what allows Google Analytics to
      collect data about visits and user behavior. After completing the setup in the previous
      step, the analytics dashboard shows the code snippet along with your Measurement ID.
    </p>

    <p>Your tracking snippet will look similar to this:</p>

    <pre><code>&lt;script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

    <p>
      To install it:
      <ul>
        <li>Open your GitHub repo in your editor or on GitHub.com</li>
        <li>Find the HTML file(s) you want to track (for example, <code>index.html</code>)</li>
        <li>Paste the tracking code inside the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> section</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Make sure the snippet appears before the closing <code>&lt;/head&gt;</code> tag so it loads
      early when a visitor opens your page.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 3: Commit and Deploy</h2>
    <p>
      After inserting the tracking script:
      <ol>
        <li>Save your changes</li>
        <li>Stage and commit them in Git</li>
        <li>Push the commit to your GitHub repository</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild your site with the updated code. You don’t need to
      change any GitHub configuration to get analytics working.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Step 4: Verify Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      To confirm Google Analytics is collecting data:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open your website in a browser</li>
      <li>In Google Analytics, navigate to <strong>Reports &gt; Realtime</strong></li>
      <li>If tracking is working correctly, you should see at least one active user (yourself)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The realtime dashboard updates quickly, so you should see activity almost instantly.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Final Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Some data may take a few minutes to appear in the full reports</li>
      <li>GA4 is the current version of Google Analytics supported by Google</li>
      <li>You can also monitor site performance and traffic using the Google Analytics mobile app</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
